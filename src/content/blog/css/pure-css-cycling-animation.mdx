# Pure CSS Cycling Animation

This is a pure CSS cycling animation, originally created by [Maria Duong](https://codepen.io/dmaristem) on CodePen, based on a Dribbble shot by Moncho Massé.

It demonstrates the power of CSS animations and keyframes to create complex movements without any JavaScript.

<div style="width: 100%; height: 600px; position: relative; overflow: hidden; border-radius: 8px; background-color: #ffd41c;">
  <CyclingAnimation />
</div>

## How it works

The animation uses SCSS for better organization, leveraging variables for colors and mixins for transforms and animations.
