# Pure CSS & SVG Animations

This post showcases powerful animations that don't rely on complex JavaScript libraries, using only CSS and SVG techniques.

## 1. Cycling Animation

Originally created by [Maria Duong](https://codepen.io/dmaristem) on CodePen, this animation uses SCSS to manage keyframes and complex element positioning.

<div style="width: 100%; height: 600px; position: relative; overflow: hidden; border-radius: 8px; background-color: #ffd41c; margin-bottom: 2rem;">
  <CyclingAnimation />
</div>

## 2. BetterUp "Insights" Gauge

Inspired by the [BetterUp Insights Report](https://grow.betterup.com/resources/insights-report-inclusive-leadership), this animation demonstrates how to create a filling "pie chart" or gauge effect using a single SVG `<path>`.

### The Technique
Instead of using complex charting libraries, we use the `stroke-dasharray` and `stroke-dashoffset` properties on a thick SVG stroke.
1.  **Path**: We draw an arc (semi-circle).
2.  **Stroke Width**: We set the stroke width equal to the radius, effectively creating a filled sector.
3.  **Animation**: We animate the `stroke-dashoffset` from the full length of the arc (invisible) to a partial length (visible slice).

</div>

## 3. Simple Text Flip

A clever text replacement animation using pure CSS `margin-top` transitions to cycle through words. Simple, effective, and lightweight.

<div style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">
  <FlipTextAnimation />
</div>

## 4. Sparkly Shiny Text

A delightful hover effect that combines text shadows, glare gradients, and SVG sparkles for a premium feel.

<div style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">
  <SparkleTextAnimation />
</div>

## 5. Secret Code Reveal

A sophisticated interaction using CSS `:has()`, trigonometric functions (`sin()`), and calc to create a "magnifying glass" blurring effect on hover.

> [!NOTE]
> This animation requires a modern browser that supports specific CSS math functions and the `:has()` selector.

<div style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">
  <SecretCodeAnimation />
</div>

## 6. Single Keyframe Tricks

A comprehensive collection of single-keyframe animation tricks using modern CSS properties and easings. Click the buttons to toggle the animations!

> [!TIP]
> This example uses open-props easings for that snappy elastic feel.

<div style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">
  <SingleKeyframeAnimations />
</div>

## 7. Realistic CSS Keyboard

A highly detailed Apple Magic Keyboard replica created entirely with CSS. It uses intricate box-shadows and borders to create depth and texture. Try tapping the Caps Lock key!

<div style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">
  <KeyboardAnimation />
</div>

## 8. Worm Hopping Radio

A playful radio button selection animation where a little "worm" hops between your choices. This uses SCSS loops to generate the delays for each segment of the worm.

<div style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">
  <WormRadioAnimation />
</div>

## 9. SVG Fireworks

A mesmerizing fireworks display using pure CSS animations on SVG elements. This example uses React to generate the complex SVG structure, demonstrating how to combine modern frameworks with advanced CSS animations.

<div style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">
  <FireworksAnimation client:visible />
</div>

## 10. Interactive Feedback UI

A deeply interactive feedback component with state transitions, particle effects, and a polished dark/light mode adaptable design. It guides the user through rating, commenting, and submission with smooth animations for every step.

<div style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">
  <FeedbackAnimation client:visible />
</div>

## 11. Slot Machine 404

A creative 404 page concept featuring a slot machine animation that eventually settles on "404". It uses the Web Animations API for the complex rolling sequences and logic.

<div style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">
  <NotFoundAnimation client:visible />
</div>

## 12. Chinese Checkers 3D

A complex 3D-effect board animation created using pure CSS and SVG clip-paths. SCSS math is used to calculate the positions of holes and balls in a circle, and clip-paths handle the z-indexing illusion of balls going into holes.

<div style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">
  <ChineseCheckersAnimation />
</div>

## 13. CSS 3D Interactive Chest

An incredible purely CSS 3D chest of drawers using `transform-style: preserve-3d`. It cleverly uses the HTML `details` and `summary` elements to handle the "click to open" interaction without any JavaScript state management.

<div style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">
  <DrawersAnimation />
</div>

## 14. 3D Spinning Dice

A continuous 3D dice rotation animation. It uses `transform-style: preserve-3d` to create the cube, and complex keyframes to handle lighting changes, shadow flipping, and the rotation itself to ensure a realistic 3D effect.

<div style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">
  <DiceAnimation />
</div>

## 15. Newton's Cradle

A classic physics demonstration recreated with CSS animations. It uses `transform-origin` to set the pivot point for the swinging balls and `ease-in`/`ease-out` timing functions to simulate the momentum transfer.

<div style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">
  <NewtonsCradleAnimation />
</div>

## 16. Jumping Lego Bricks

A playful animation of a stack of Lego bricks jumping and rearranging themselves. It heavily utilizes SVG `symbol` for reusability and complex SCSS loops to generate color variations and staggered animations.

<div style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">
  <LegoBricksAnimation />
</div>

## 17. Infinite Card Stack

A mesmerizing infinite loop of cards being stacked. It uses `transform-style: preserve-3d` and precise `translateZ` animations to creating the illusion of depth and continuous movement.

<div style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">
  <CardStackAnimation />
</div>

## 18. Abstract 3D Fabric Hero

An artistic interpretation of the [Twinbru](https://twinbru.com/) hero section. It features a central sun-burst "fan" constructed from 90 individual rotated blades, paired with floating spheres that simulate fabric textures using SVG noise filters and radial gradients.

<div style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">
