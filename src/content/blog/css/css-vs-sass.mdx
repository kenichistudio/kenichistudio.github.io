# CSS vs. SASS: Elevating Your Styles

Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is the backbone of web styling, but as projects grow, maintaining plain CSS can become cumbersome. Enter **SASS** (Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets), a preprocessor that extends CSS with powerful features like variables, nesting, and mixins.

## Key Differences

| Feature | CSS | SASS (SCSS) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Variables** | Native CSS Variables (`--var-name`) | SASS Variables (`$var-name`) |
| **Nesting** | Newly supported (native nesting) | Deeply supported and widely used |
| **Mixins** | Not available (requires repeated code) | `@mixin` and `@include` for reusable blocks |
| **Functions** | `calc()`, `min()`, `max()`, etc. | Custom functions + built-in color manipulation |

## 1. Variables

SASS variables are compiled away, while CSS variables remain in the DOM, allowing for dynamic changes (like theming).

```scss
// SCSS
$primary-color: #3498db;

.btn {
  background: $primary-color;
}
```

```css
/* CSS */
:root {
  --primary-color: #3498db;
}

.btn {
  background: var(--primary-color);
}
```

## 2. Nesting

Nesting in SASS mirrors the HTML structure, making code more readable.

```scss
// SCSS
nav {
  ul {
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
    list-style: none;
  }

  li { display: inline-block; }

  a {
    display: block;
    padding: 6px 12px;
    text-decoration: none;
  }
}
```

## 3. Mixins

Mixins allow you to define styles that can be re-used throughout your stylesheet.

```scss
@mixin transform($property) {
  -webkit-transform: $property;
  -ms-transform: $property;
  transform: $property;
}

.box { @include transform(rotate(30deg)); }
```

## Conclusion

While modern CSS is evolving rapidly with features like native nesting and variables, SASS still offers a robust set of tools for large-scale application development, particularly with its powerful mixin and function capabilities.
