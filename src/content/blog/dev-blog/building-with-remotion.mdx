# Building the Next Generation of Video Tools with Remotion

If you're a React developer looking to build video apps, there's only one serious contender in 2026: **[Remotion](https://www.remotion.dev/)**.

At Kinetix, we use Remotion to power our entire rendering engine. But we didn't just use it out of the box—we built a custom architecture around it.

Here is how Kinetix compares to the standard [Remotion Editor Starter](https://editor-starter.remotion.dev/).

## The Foundation: Remotion Editor Starter

The [Editor Starter](https://editor-starter.remotion.dev/) is an incredible boilerplate provided by the Remotion team. It gives you:
*   **React-based Timeline**: A simple track-based editor.
*   **Preview Player**: Using `@remotion/player`.
*   **Basic Compisitions**: A "Hello World" example.

It's using modern tech like **React 19**, **Tailwind CSS v4**, and **Vite**.

While powerful, it's designed as a starting point. It requires you to build your own rendering backend (usually via AWS Lambda) and doesn't handle complex non-linear editing out of the box.

## How Kinetix Goes Further

We took the core of Remotion (programmatic video rendering) and wrapped it in a full-featured creative suite.

### 1. Two Specialized Editors
Instead of a generic timeline, we split our tool into two:
*   **[Kinetix Create](/kinetix/create)**: A generative diagramming tool. You type text, and we generate the Remotion composition for you using **Mermaid.js** and **Markmap**.
*   **[Kinetix Animator](/kinetix/animator)**: A professional keyframe timeline. We built a custom state engine on top of `@remotion/player` to handle complex easings and nested sequences.

### 2. Client-Side Rendering (No Servers!)
The standard Remotion workflow relies on **Server-Side Rendering**. You send your props to a server, it launches a headless browser, records the screen, and sends back an MP4.

This is robust but expensive and slow.

**Kinetix does it differently.** We use **MediaBunny** (see our [previous post](/kinetix/blog/under-the-hood-mediabunny)) to capture the Remotion `<Player />` directly in your browser and encode it to MP4 using WebCodecs.

This means:
*   **Zero Cost**: Free high-res exports.
*   **Privacy**: Your data never leaves your device.
*   **Offline Support**: Export while on a plane.

## Conclusion

Remotion provides the primitives—the `<Sequence>`, the `useCurrentFrame`, the synchronization. Kinetix builds the house.

If you're building a video app today, start with Remotion. It's the "React for Video" we've always dreamed of.
