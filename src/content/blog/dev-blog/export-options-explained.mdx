# Export Options Explained

Kinetix now offers two distinct ways to export your animations: **Offline Render** and **Realtime Record**. Understanding the difference is key to getting the best results for your needs.

## 1. Offline Render (High Quality)

This is the default and recommended mode for final production.

### How it works
The engine pauses the timeline and advances it frame-by-frame (e.g., exactly 1/60th of a second). For each frame, it takes a high-resolution snapshot and sends it to a background worker for encoding.

### Pros
- **Perfect Smoothness**: Guarantees a stable 60 FPS (or 30 FPS) regardless of your computer's speed.
- **No Lag Artifacts**: If your animation is heavy and lags during playback, the offline render will still be silky smooth because it doesn't care about real-time performance.
- **High Quality**: Uses 2-pass encoding (conceptually) or high-bitrate settings.

### Cons
- **Slower**: Takes longer than the actual video duration to render (usually 1.5x - 2x realtime).

## 2. Realtime Record (Fast)

This mode captures the canvas exactly as you see it during playback.

### How it works
The engine plays the animation at normal speed, and we capture the stream using the browser's `MediaRecorder` API or a `MediaStreamTrackProcessor`.

### Pros
- **Fast**: Exports exactly efficiently as the video duration (1x speed).
- **Instant Feedback**: Good for quick "draft" shares to Discord or Slack.

### Cons
- **Performance Dependent**: If your computer lags during playback, the exported video will lag too.
- **Variable Framerate**: Browsers might drop frames if the system is busy.

## Formats: WebM vs MP4 vs MOV

### WebM
- **Engine**: Native Browser Stack / `webm-muxer`.
- **Pros**: Fastest to encode, open source, works great on web.
- **Cons**: Not supported natively on iOS or QuickTime.

### MP4 (H.264)
- **Engine**: **MediaBunny**.
- **Pros**: Universally compatible (Windows, Mac, iPhone, Android, Social Media).
- **Cons**: Slower to encode than WebM.

### MOV
- **Engine**: **MediaBunny**.
- **Pros**: Preferred for video editing workflows (Final Cut, Premiere).
- **Cons**: Larger file sizes.

## Recommendation

- **For Final Polish**: Use **Offline Render** + **MP4**.
- **For Quick Drafts**: Use **Realtime Record** + **WebM**.
