Vectors are the unsung heroes of the modern web. In his article, *A Friendly Introduction to SVG*, Josh W. Comeau breaks down why SVGs are more than just "sharp images"—they are a powerful, code-accessible format that bridges the gap between design and development.

## What is SVG?

Unlike JPGs or PNGs, which are grids of colored pixels, **SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics)** is a document format. It's built with XML, just like HTML.

Instead of saying "Pixel (0,0) is red," an SVG says "Draw a circle at (50, 50) with a radius of 20."

## 1. The Power of Code

Because SVGs are technically documents, they can be embedded directly into HTML. This makes them a "First-Class Citizen" of the DOM. 

**Standard Image (.png)**
Reviewing a `.png` is like looking at a photograph of a building. You can see it, but you can't open a window or repaint a specific wall.

**Inline SVG**
Reviewing an `.svg` is like having the blueprints. You can use CSS to change the color of the roof on hover, or JavaScript to make the windows slide open.

## 2. Basic Shapes

SVG comes with its own set of drawing primitives. If HTML has `<div>` and `<p>`, SVG has:

*   **`<rect>`**: Rectangles defined by `x`, `y`, `width`, and `height`.
*   **`<circle>`**: Defined by a center point (`cx`, `cy`) and radius (`r`).
*   **`<line>`**: A straight path from `(x1, y1)` to `(x2, y2)`.
*   **`<path>`**: The ultimate building block, capable of drawing complex curves and shapes using a sequence of commands.

## 3. The ViewBox: An Infinite Canvas

One of the most confusing parts of SVG is the `viewBox`. Josh explains it as a "camera" looking at an infinite coordinate plane.

> **The ViewBox Analogy**
>
> Imagine an infinite piece of paper. You can draw a shape 1,000 miles to the right. The **ViewBox** determines where your camera is pointing and how much of that paper it can see.
>
> `viewBox="min-x min-y width height"`
>
> It decouples the *drawing coordinates* from the *screen size*. This is what makes SVGs "Scalable"—the internal math remains valid regardless of how big the image appears on screen.

## 4. Presentational Attributes

Styling in SVG feels distinct from standard CSS, though many concepts map over:
*   **`fill`**: The background color of a shape.
*   **`stroke`**: The border color.
*   **`stroke-width`**: The thickness of the border.

Because these are attributes, they can be controlled via CSS!

```css
circle {
  fill: blue;
  transition: fill 0.3s ease;
}

circle:hover {
  fill: red;
}
```

This interaction—hovering over a specific part of an illustration to trigger a change—is impossible with standard image formats.

## Summary

SVG is not just a file format; it's a language for describing graphics. By understanding its primitives and coordinate system, developers can create responsive, accessible, and highly interactive illustrations that go far beyond what is possible with raster images.
